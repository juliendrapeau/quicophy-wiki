# QuICoPhy Wiki

*Please read the whole README before contributing.*

The primary goal of this wiki is to serve as the **central hub for our research group's collective knowledge**. By consolidating key resources, we aim to:

- **Enhance Workflow**: Streamline access to information and reduce the time spent searching for or duplicating resources.
- **Foster Collaboration**: Provide a shared platform where members can contribute, share insights, and expand on each other's work.
- **Prevent Duplication**: Minimize redundant efforts by centralizing our knowledge in a single, accessible repository.

## Repository Structure

To keep our wiki organized and easily navigable, we have structured the repository into several main directories. Each directory serves a specific purpose, allowing users to quickly find and contribute relevant content.

### **00 - Getting Started**
This section is designed for newcomers to our research group. It includes:
- **Introduction to the Group**: Overview of our research areas, goals, and team members.
- **Onboarding Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up necessary tools and accessing group resources.
- **Group Policies and Procedures**: Essential guidelines for communication, collaboration, and research ethics within the group.

### **01 - Compendium of Physics**
This directory houses a comprehensive collection of notes, resources, and explanations related to the physics topics central to our research. Content here includes:
- **Core Concepts**: In-depth notes on fundamental physics principles.
- **Specialized Topics**: Detailed explorations of specific areas of interest, including recent developments and ongoing research.
- **Lecture Notes**: Summaries and analyses of key lectures and seminars attended by group members.

### **02 - Tools of the Trade**
This section is dedicated to the tools and technologies we use in our research. It includes:
- **Software Guides**: Tutorials and best practices for software tools like Python, MATLAB, and LaTeX.
- **Hardware Resources**: Documentation on lab equipment, including setup instructions and maintenance tips.
- **Data Analysis Techniques**: Methods and scripts for analyzing experimental and computational data.

### **03 - Academia and Industry**
Here, we collect resources that bridge the gap between academic research and industry applications. Content includes:
- **Publication Tips**: Guides on writing and submitting papers, including formatting and journal selection.
- **Industry Collaborations**: Documentation of partnerships, joint projects, and tech transfer opportunities.
- **Career Development**: Advice on building a career in academia or transitioning to industry roles.

### **04 - Weekly Meetings**
This directory contains summaries and materials from our weekly group meetings. It includes:
- **Meeting Agendas**: Outlines of topics to be discussed in upcoming meetings.
- **Meeting Minutes**: Summaries of discussions, decisions, and action items from past meetings.
- **Presentation Slides**: Slides from presentations given during meetings, along with any relevant supplementary materials.

### **05 - Zoo of References**
The Zoo of References is a curated library of references that supports our research. It includes:
- **Papers and Articles**: Key publications relevant to our research, organized by topic.
- **Books and Textbooks**: Recommended readings, including annotations and notes on important chapters.
- **Reference Materials**: Links to databases, online tools, and other resources that are frequently used by the group.

### **99 - Miscellaneous**
This section is a catch-all for content that doesn’t fit neatly into the other categories. It includes:
- **Archived Notes**: Older notes that are no longer actively used but may still be of interest.
- **Experimental Ideas**: Brainstorming sessions, preliminary thoughts, and exploratory concepts.
- **Miscellaneous Resources**: Any other material that might be useful but doesn’t have a specific home elsewhere in the repository.

## Usage


For newcomers, we recommend starting 


After getting a bit of experience with GitHub, we recommend combining GitHub with the note taking application obsidian.

However, we try to design this wiki to accommodate everybody uses.

- **Obsidian**: For easy navigation and linking between files. 
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration. 
- **VSCode**: For editing Markdown files. 
- **MkDocs**: For creating a static site from the Markdown files.
- **Logseq**: For note-taking and organizing research ideas.

## Guidelines

This wiki is a **living document**—constantly evolving with our research. Contributions are crucial, and every member is encouraged to add their expertise. The wiki’s value lies in its collaborative nature, where knowledge is shared and refined continuously.

To maintain the quality and cohesion of our contributions, we ask that everyone follows these principles:

- **Be Collaborative**: Engage in open discussions when modifying or expanding existing content.
- **Be Thorough**: Only add complete, well-developed notes. The wiki should not contain unfinished drafts.
- **Be Original**: Contribute content unique to our group’s needs, avoiding easily accessible information found elsewhere online.
- 
To ensure consistency and high quality, the following rules must be adhered to:

- **No WikiLinks**: Avoid using WikiLinks (be mindful of spaces; use `< >` or `%20`).
- **Logseq Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with Logseq.
- **Follow Repository Structure**: Adhere to the organization of the repository.
- **Content Guidelines**:
  - Focus on **course notes**.
  - Prioritize **introductory notes** that facilitate access to a subject or technical element not easily found elsewhere.
  - **No code**: You may include a link to a repository or a small block of code directly in the Markdown. We also accept ONE Python or Jupyter script acting solely as a tutorial.
  - **No incomplete notes**: Only add complete, well-written notes. Ensure that the notes are relevant and not easily found on the internet.
  - **Use common sense**: Apply your best judgment when contributing.
  - **Author Attribution**: Add yourself as an author and follow at least the basic template provided in `99`.
  - **Existing Notes**: It is always possible to add information to an existing note (don’t forget to add yourself as an author).
  - **Modifying Existing Notes**: Before modifying an existing note, discuss it with the original author. If the author is no longer available, take the lead!

## Contributions

- **Encouragement**: Contributions are strongly encouraged.
- **Branching**: Use a single branch, except for potential major modifications (e.g., creating a website).
- **Direct Commits**: Commit directly unless making significant changes and needing to consult with others.
- **Raising Issues**: Don’t hesitate to raise issues if you encounter problems or have suggestions.
